   Way to go Steven,
   You've just joined Chicago's oldest and fastest growing hackerspace!
   Whether you're transferring in from another or a brand new member, we're
   glad to have you here.
   We want you to get the most of your brand new membership, so there are a
   few things you can do to get started right away.

     * Please print and [1]fill out a waiver and give it to any member of the
       Board of Directors on the next Tuesday you're available to come in
       (copies are available at the space).
     * To get your code for the door, you have to show a form of
       identification to two board members. This is the only way to get the
       door code and is easiest done on a Tuesday. Afterwards, you'll have 24
       hour access.
     * Join our [2]private mailing list. This is where our members-only
       announcements, safety warnings, and event announcements show up. You
       can't engage with our community if you aren't on there. If you have
       any questions, please send them to the private list! All members are
       on it and are able to answer your questions.
     * You should create a ps1 account by [3]activating at our member's site.
       This account will automagically allow you to: log into the wiki and
       log into the computers at the space.
     * Once a month, we hold a class called PS1 Orientation. It's a great way
       to get oriented to the space and learn your way around the community -
       keep an eye on the mailing list for the next announced class. I highly
       recommend attending. Until then, feel free to look at the [4]Member
       Manual, which will answer many questions including how to get
       certified on our equipment.

   We are nothing without our community and you wouldn't believe what can
   happen out of cooperation. Just being around discussion of projects and
   ideas can unlock creativity and motivation for your own projects, so don't
   hesitate to get involved!
